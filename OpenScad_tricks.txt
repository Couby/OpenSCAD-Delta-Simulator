OPENSCAD TRICKS : - Pierre Rouzeau - 29 may 2015   rev. June 2015  licence : CC-by-sa
1/ Variables in OpenScad behave as constants
2/ Transparency.  Transparent panels are only transparent for already built elements
3/ Warnings on undefined variables  - set $ as first caracter of your variable
4/ Creating own operators is very easy with children();
5/ The camera variables have only an effect is set at top level – conditional definitions
     ------------------------------------------
1/ Variables in OpenScad behave as constants
- look the OpenScad doc on variables
OpenScad looks a strange langage as it is a functional language
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming
which means that variables have only one value during their entire life, which could not 
be modified and is set at compile time. The advantage is that you could set values in 
command line, but only for top level variables. 
if a variable value is set multiple times, the last set will be used at execution,
 whatever the order of other instructions.
  a=1; 
  b=1;
  c= a+b;
  echo (c);
  a=2;
the result of echo() will be 3! 
However, while you use a variable in a module, each module run creates a new instance 
of the variable, so value could differ at each call of a module  (but is calculated 
during compilation)
It means that you cannot set the value of a variable in a if condition, neither in a loop.
For variable allocation depending from other variables, you could use the '?' selector.
The trick:
If you have multiple conditions, you shall create multiple variables in sequence, using
only the last one
myVar1 = condition1? val01:val02;
myVar2 = condition2? val03:myVar1;
myVar3 = condition3? val04:myVar2;
Those sequential conditions could be grouped in a unique one. 
You find a good example of this method in 'Delta_simulator.scad' in the  'view()'
module for the trajectory calculation.

2/ Transparency.  Transparent panels are only transparent for already built elements
Transparency is only calculated against the elements already built, so if you set
elements after transparent panels, you wont see them.
The simple solution is to built the transparent panels last.

3/ Warnings on undefined variables  - set $ as first character of your variable
OpenScad don't crash if variables are not defined, so this could be used for selection.
However, undefined variables gives a warning in the console.
An undocumented information is that an undefined variable whose name start with '$'
won't drive to warning if the variable is undefined. The '$' is part of the name.

4/ Creating own operators is very easy with children();
The children() function represent the parameter of an operator, so creating your own
operators is very easy. Look the library at the end of the program. It could be used
multiple times in a module (for duplication).

5/ The camera variables have only an effect is set at top level – conditional definitions
In addition, as they are variables, they couldn't be defined in an if condition, but as
they are '$' variables, you will have no warning of your mistake.
use the '?' selector to set these variables, example:
$vpd = condition1?value1:undef;
$vpd = condition2?value2:undef;
