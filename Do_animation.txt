HOW TO BUILD AN ANIMATION
The only action of Openscad animation routine is to modify the $t variable
from 0 to 1 in a number of steps defined in the animation panel at a defined speed. 
see menu [view][animate].
To move the effector in an animation, you shall create a function which return
 a x,y,z curve from $t, then use resulting x,y,z to run function 'simul (x,y,z)'. 
 see the view() function as example.
The example function do multiple sequences in two rotations. so if you define 360 steps,
 there will be a rotation of 2Â° between two steps.
An interesting property of animate is that you could modify the program during the
 animation (in fact, the program is recompiled for each frame). Super-fast debugging.
A camera position is set in the parameters. To deactivate this camera (to view details, 
carriage or arm conflicts), set the variable 'camPos'  (line 14) to 'false', this will 
deactivate the camera position and you will be able to freely position your model. 
Also, it is possible to define a camera movement in the animation by linking camera
variables to $t variable.
You could then build a film with VirtualDub or other program.
In VirtualDub, you shall use a resize filter for compression (if not, it crashes).
 Use even pixel numbers for the size.
